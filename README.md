# Unaeruhr
Code and Layout for my unary clock

The unary clock is inspired by the clock on the "Rheinturm" in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany. 

It's three lines with each tens (10-50) and ones (1-9) to display hours, minutes and seconds.
With a button, the display can be switched to show the date (month and day).
Another button can control the time

Later, DCF77 will be added to update the time automatically.

Still Work in Progress!!
